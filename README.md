## Project Overview.
In this project, I will do well to chronicle all the commands and analysis done the class. The structured query language uses simple every day English terms, however, for analysis some commands had to be used to display the needed results.

### Data Sources.
Most of the data for SQL are imported, however some queries will be written out here to show how some table are created.
